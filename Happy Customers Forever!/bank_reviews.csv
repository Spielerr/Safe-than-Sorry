My suggestion is they have to improve the service and be more customer friendly. All counter staffs needs training on customer handling. They should report for duty on time and work fast.  (eg)  for withdrawal of cash from counter the staff over there counts the cash manually then places the notes to the counting machine and then again he recounts.  Why?  That means he is not confident on his counting nor machine?  Or just to waste the time he is adopting this practice.   |TITTYKURIAN  KURIAN|                                     , chennai|                                     Reviewed on Mar 15, 2016

The money will be deducted from your bank account. After the money is deducted, the bank employee will handover a fixed deposit certificate to you.
