                                Interest rate and processing fee charged were very good enough.The car loan disbursement was done within 10 days as the bank manger was my friend. Documentation was good but all the process was completed by myself by visiting the bank directly. No customer service is given by the bank. Only the eligible enough customers can approach the bank for the process.

The interest rate is reduced from 8.75 to 8.5.
To save the tax provide the PAN card number.

The procedure to apply the fixed deposit manually is simple. Go to the branch, get the fixed deposit form. Fill the form. Handover to the bank employee. The money will be deducted from your bank account. After the money is deducted, the bank employee will handover a fixed deposit certificate to you.

After the maturity, go back to the bank with the fixed deposit certificate, to get back the cash. The cash will be deposited in your bank account.|Siddarth|                                     , coimbatore|                                     Reviewed on Jun 05, 2015

The atms  never work for any queries the response is not up to the mark. We have to visit the bank many times. Online banking is  good.  My suggestion is they have to improve the service and be more customer friendly. All counter staffs needs training on customer handling. They should report for duty on time and work fast.  (eg)  for withdrawal of cash from counter the staff over there counts the cash manually then places the notes to the counting machine and then again he recounts.  Why?  That means he is not confident on his counting nor machine?  Or just to waste the time he is adopting this practice.   |TITTYKURIAN  KURIAN|                                     , chennai|                                     Reviewed on Mar 15, 2016

                                Indian Bank service should be more proactive, I have zero balance account with them. They have less atm centers, hence they need to enhance it more. The bank staff are not so friendly to help on customer's queries. However I have been banking with them around three  years, I would say the bank is trusted and safe.
