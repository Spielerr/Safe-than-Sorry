adding folders to git repo
1. clone the repo
2. copy the desired folder into your repo
3. git status
4. git add folder-name / git add -A (to add all the folders - recommended)
5. git commit -m 'commit message'
6. git push origin master
(If git push origin master doesnt work cuz someone else pushed and all, just do)
7. git pull origin master


removing a folder from your git repo
1. clone the repo
2. rmdir folder-name
3. git status
4. git add removed-folder-name
next two steps same as the those above
